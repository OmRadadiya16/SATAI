To find the length of chord AB, draw a perpendicular from O to AB, let's call the intersection point M. This perpendicular bisects both the angle AOB and the chord AB.\n\nSo, in the right triangle OMA:\nAngle AOM = (1/2) * Angle AOB = (1/2) * 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0.\nOA (the hypotenuse) = 6 units.\n\nWe can use trigonometry to find AM:\nsin(\u2220AOM) = AM / OA\nsin(60\u00b0) = AM / 6\n\nWe know that sin(60\u00b0) = \u221a3 / 2.\nSo, \u221a3 / 2 = AM / 6\nMultiply both sides by 6: AM = 6 * (\u221a3 / 2) = 3\u221a3 units.\n\nSince M bisects AB, the length of the chord AB is 2 * AM.\nAB = 2 * (3\u221a3) = 6\u221a3 units."

The angle of elevation is 45 degrees. We can form a right triangle where 'h' is the opposite side and 20 feet is the adjacent side to the 45-degree angle. \n\nUsing the tangent function: tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(45\u00b0) = h / 20\n\nSince tan(45\u00b0) = 1, we have:\n1 = h / 20\nh = 20 feet\n\nThis 'h' is the height from the person's eye level to the top of the flagpole. The person's eyes are 5 feet above the ground. Therefore, the total height of the flagpole is the height above eye level plus the eye level height:\nTotal height = h + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 feet."

We can use the algebraic identity for the sum of cubes: $x^3+y^3 = (x+y)(x^2-xy+y^2)$.\n\nTo use this identity, we first need to find the value of $xy$. We know that the square of the sum $(x+y)$ is related to $x^2+y^2$ and $xy$ by the identity:\n$(x+y)^2 = x^2+2xy+y^2$\n\nSubstitute the given values into this identity:\n$7^2 = (31) + 2xy$\n$49 = 31 + 2xy$\n\nTo find $2xy$, subtract 31 from both sides:\n$49 - 31 = 2xy$\n$18 = 2xy$\n\nNow, divide by 2 to find $xy$:\n$xy = 9$\n\nFinally, substitute the values of $(x+y)$, $(x^2+y^2)$, and $(xy)$ into the sum of cubes identity:\n$x^3+y^3 = (x+y)((x^2+y^2)-xy)$\n$x^3+y^3 = (7)((31)-(9))$\n$x^3+y^3 = (7)(22)$\n$x^3+y^3 = 154"
