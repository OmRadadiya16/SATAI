We can form a right triangle where 'h' is the opposite side and 20 feet is the adjacent side to the 45-degree angle. \n\nUsing the tangent function: tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent\ntan(45\u00b0) = h / 20\n\nSince tan(45\u00b0) = 1, we have:\n1 = h / 20\nh = 20 feet\n\nThis 'h' is the height from the person's eye level to the top of the flagpole.

It also shifts the emphasis to the action of the astronomers rather than the finding itself.\nOption C rephrases the relationship but places 'has proven crucial' at the end, which slightly diminishes the immediate emphasis on the finding's crucial role in *proving* the hypothesis compared to option D's structure and stronger phrasing ('direct evidence')."
